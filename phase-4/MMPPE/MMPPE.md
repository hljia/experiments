# Multi-Model PPE Experiment

## Organizers
- Hailing Jia ([h.jia@sron.nl](mailto:h.jia@sron.nl))

## Deadlines for Submission of Model Data
- **[One-At-a-Time Test](#one-at-a-time-test):** 31 July 2026
- **[PPE Experiments](#ppe-simulations):** 30 September 2026


## Motivation
To understand and constrain the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing (ACI+ARI) in different model systems, a Multi-Model Perturbed Parameter Ensemble (MMPPE) involving different aerosol- and cloud-related parameters is needed. With this, we will be able to jointly tackle two dominant sources of model uncertainty: structural uncertainty and parametric uncertainty. The AeroCom MMPPE experiment is also linked to the CMIP7 Aerosol-Cloud Interactions Perturbed Parameter Ensemble Model Intercomparison Project ([ACI-PPEMIP](https://wcrp-cmip.org/mips/)).


## Objectives
- Quantify parametric uncertainty across different models and assess the relative contributions of parametric versus structural uncertainties.
- Constrain parametric uncertainty using new observations from 2025, (e.g., EarthCARE and PACE).
- Identify structural deficiencies in models and guide improvements to parameterizations.


## Proposed Model Experiments

### General Simulation Requirements
- **Simulation Period:** 1850 for Preindustrial (PI) and 2025 for present-day (PD).
- **Spin-up:** 3-month CTL run (spin-up; starting 1 July 2024 )  + 3-month CTL+PPE runs (spin-up; starting 1 Oct 2024) + 1-year CTL+PPE production runs (2025). CTL denotes the control simulation using the model's default parameter settings.

- **Nudging:** Both PI and PD winds (not temperature or relative humidity) are nudged towards reanalysis data. Nudging to ERA5 with a relaxation timescale of ~6 hours above the boundary layer (~2 km) is recommended. Other reanalyses or nudging configurations (e.g.,throughout the atmospheric column or difference relaxation time) are also acceptable.

- **CFMIP COSP:** Optional, but highly desirable for models with COSP

- **Ensemble size:** The number of simulations should be at least 6 times the number of [perturbed parameters](#perturbed-parameters), with a target ratio of 8 where possible. For example, a PPE with 29 (mandatory + recommended) parameters, plus 1 CTL run, requires a minimum of (29 × 6 + 1) × 2 = 350 simulations (PI+PD).

- **Input/Forcing datasets** (kept as consistent as possible with CMIP7):

    - **Anthropogenic emission:** CEDS v2025-04-18 (available for 1850-2023; 2022-2023 repeated for 2024-2025)
    - **Biomass burning emission:** GFED5.1 (daily) for PD; CMIP7 biomass burning (monthly) for PI
    - **GHGs and ozone:** CMIP7 ScenarioMIP `m` for GHGs, `vl` for ozone (only `vl` and `h` are currently available)
    - **SST/SIC:** Prescribed from ERA5 monthly data for the year 2025 for both PI and PD runs


    >**Note**: All above inputs are available at https://public.spider.surfsara.nl/project/polder/hjia/MMPPE_input. Most datasets are provided at fine spatial resolution (e.g., 0.25° × 0.25°) to be regridded to match your model resolution.

### PPE Experiments

| Experiment | Emissions | Nudging | SST & SIC | Other forcing |
|------------|-----------|---------|---------|---------------|
| PI         | 1850      | 2025    | 2025     |2025| 
| PD         | 2025      | 2025    | 2025     |2025     |      

### One-At-a-Time Test

To ensure that all parameters are wired properly, **a five-day One-At-a-Time (OAT) test for PD (1–5 Aug 2025) is strongly recommended before the PPE runs.** In each OAT simulation, one parameter is set to its lower or upper bound while all others remain at their default values.

**Spin-up**: first perform a 3-month spin-up of the default CTL run, then initialize all OAT runs from the same CTL state at 1 Aug 2025.

**Variables to test:**

### Perturbed Parameters
We focus on multiple aerosol- and cloud-related processes. For aerosols, they are aerosol emissions, optical and hygroscopic properties, wet and dry depositions, nucleation,  aging and chemistry, with a special focus on emissions from biomass burning and natural sources. For clouds, the targeted processes/schemes include activation, cloud microphysics, cloud cover, convection, optical processes, and turbulence. See [Jia et al. (2026)](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2026-3275) for more detials.

**Latin hypercube sampling** strategy is used to generate parameter values for each ensemble member. An example Python script can be found at: https://github.com/hljia/LHS_example

Parameters labeled "Rel" are scaling factors relative to the control values, whereas those labeled "Abs" are absolute values. 

>**Note**: If the default parameter value in your model differs substantially from the protocol value (e.g., lies close to or outside the prescribed range), please scale the parameter range proportionally to preserve the same min/default and max/default ratios.

#### Mandatory (21)
These parameters are not model-dependent, so all models should be able to perturb them.

### Output size estimate

For a 1-year simulation:

- M/2D: ~2 MB per variable
- M/3D: ~2 × 47 (levels) = 94 MB per variable
- 6H/2D: ~2 × 4 × 30 = 240 MB per variable
- 6H/3D: ~2 × 4 × 30 × 8 (levels) = 1.9 GB per variable

PPEs with 350 ensemble members in total (PD + PI) would generate (optional variables in parentheses):

- M/2D: ~350 × 100(+6) × 2 MB = 68(+4) GB
- M/3D: ~350 × 25 × 94 MB = 803 GB
- 6H/2D: ~350 × 62(+10) × 240 MB = 5.0(+0.8) TB
- 6H/3D: ~175 × 1 × 1.9 GB = 0.32 TB (ec355aer only for PD)

**Total: ~6.2 TB for mandatory variables + ~0.8 TB for optional variables.**

## Model Output Submission

For **One-At-a-Time Test**, please
- Upload your csv file and OAT plots to the google drive folder [ACI-PPEMIP_OAT/](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V1c-4pqVWfcsTqqsZ4UamWCuBw-jrNvz?usp=drive_link) (please create a subfolder for your model)
-  Enter your parameter ranges in the spreadsheet [ACI-PPEMIP parameter ranges](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tHGisfeP_58EO69tO5mt5H-nEfxcTZLcGYEDKeKs-v0/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
- You will see examples for ICON-HAM PPE there

For **PPE experiments**, submit the following data via the AeroCom website ([Submit Data](https://aerocom.met.no/FAQ/data_access/submit_data)):

- A text file listing the ensemble IDs and corresponding parameter values, i.e., `PPE_values_<ModelName>.txt` generated by [Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) code](https://github.com/hljia/LHS_example). Ensemble ID `exp_0` represents the control run.

- Required outputs from the control run + all LHS-generated ensemble members.

>**Note**: it is recommended to use NetCDF compression (e.g., -z zip_4 in CDO) to reduce output file size.




### Model Output Naming Convention
The format for the AeroCom file name (one variable per file) should be:

`aerocom4_<ModelName>_<YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME>-<SimulationName>_<VariableName>_<VerticalCoordinateType>_<Year>_<Freq>.nc`

#### Example Filenames
- **2-D:** `aerocom4_ICON-HAM_<YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME>-PD_aod_Surface_2025_monthly.nc`
- **3-D:** `aerocom4_ICON-HAM_<YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME>-PD_aod_ModelLevel_2025_monthly.nc`
- **3-D (reduced levels):** `aerocom4_ICON-HAM_<YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME>-PD_aerext_CustomLevel_2025_monthly.nc` (only for aerosol extinction)
